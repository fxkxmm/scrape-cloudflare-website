# scrape cloudflare website

Mordern website are getting more and more technially advanced, this has significatly raised the bar for extracting data from the sites. This is due to one of the facts that there are many iresponsible spiders/crawlers/scrapers hitting the site without mananing the web traffic and visit frequency and hence resulting the target webserver bearing a lot of burdens! At the end, website owners have to take a lot of efforts to protect their sites from abused by those bad robots!

Cloudflare, Inc. is an American web infrastructure and website security company that provides content delivery network and DDoS mitigation services. Its services occur between a website's visitor and the Cloudflare customer's hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites.
